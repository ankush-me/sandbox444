Possible enhancements and directions of development, in no particular
order:

- XML appender compatible with Chainsaw GUI.

- EventLog library appender.

- org.apache.log4j.net.ZeroConfSocketHubAppender.

- Reading log4j-like XML configuration files.

- More flexible events format for transport over network. ASN.1? XML?
  YAML? JSON?.

- Syslog appender capable of logging using UDP to another host.

- Modular PatternLayout; public PatternConverter classes; user defined
  format specifiers.

- More flexible log file rotation, like keeping only last 31 days of
  logs produced by DailyRollingFileAppender, etc.
